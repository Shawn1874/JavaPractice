Dear Tori,
Grace and I were happy to show Stanley around San Diego.  We both miss you and Ethan very much and we hope to see you soon.  California has many different things to do so we took Stanley to a variety of places.  One Saturday morning, I took him on a hike to the top of Mt. Woodson.  In the pictures you can see him near a landmark we call “Potato Chip rock”.  You can see some people standing on it.  Every weekend hundreds of people hike to the top to get their picture taken on the edge of it.  
We also took some nice pictures of the view of the valley down below.  San Diego has many beaches, so we took him to Coronado and La Jolla cove.   You can see one picture of us at the Hotel Del Coronado, and one with a view of downtown San Diego across the bay that separates San Diego from Coronado island.  We were able to walk on the beach in La Jolla right near the waves crashing against the shore.  
While he was visiting, I had to travel for business to Washington D.C., so I took Stanley along with me.  We visited the beautiful WWII memorial, and walked around the National Mall. We also visited the memorial of Abraham Lincoln, the 13th President of the U.S.  We saw the reflection pool, the Washington monument, and the Capital building where Congress meets and conducts business.  I think he enjoyed his stay with us, but he is also looking forward to returning to NJ so that you and your class can learn about his adventures and see his pictures.

Love,
Shawn and Grace
