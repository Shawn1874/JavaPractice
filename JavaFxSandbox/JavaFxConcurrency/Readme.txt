The project was designed according to the requirements but without prompting the user for a number of files since the user can select any number of files via the file chooser dialog.  However, the counter can't count the words in a binary file properly.  This edge case was not accounted for, but the advantage of the file chooser is that you are not limited to the files that I commit to source control for testing.  You can choose any text file on your system.
