Using the skills you have learned related to Database in this lesson, install the Apache Derby
Database and create a database named COREJAVA.

Then write a Java console application named Lesson7Database that reads in the attached file 
(Lessons.sql) and uses JDBC to populate the database. After populating the database, query the
Lessons table metadata to read the column names. Use these column names as the headers for your
output. Then query the contents of the Lessons table, displaying each lesson number and title on
a separate line.

$ java Lesson7Database Lessons.sql
Database Connection info: ...
Connecting to the database: Done.
Populating the database: Done.
Query of Lessons table results:

Turn in your project as a single ZIP file named Lesson7Database-FNAME-LNAME.zip, where FNAME is
your firstname and LNAME is your last-name.
