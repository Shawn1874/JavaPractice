Using the skills you have learned related to Network Programming in this lesson, write TWO Java 
console applications, one named Lesson6NetworkingServer and the other named 
Lesson6NetworkingClient.

- Lesson6NetworkingServer. --port NUMBER. 
When you start up the Lesson6NetworkingServer, give it a port number to listen on. 
When a client connects to the server, send back the following:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
<head><title>Java Networking</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Java Networking</h1>
</body>
</html>

- Lesson6NetworkingClient --server ADDRESS --port PORT. 
After starting up the Lesson6NetworkingServer, in another console window startup the 
Lesson6NetworkingClient, specifying the server address and port number. Then connect to the 
server, and display the info returned by the server to the console.
- Use your web-browser to also connect to the server. What do you observe?

Turn in your project as a single ZIP file named Lesson6Networking-FNAME-LNAME.zip, 
where FNAME is your firstname and LNAME is your last-name.

NOTE: Please submit as a .zip file. Do not submit as .rar or .7z. Only .zip file please.
